From our vast experience on Odoo implementations so far, we suggest following steps to secure your Odoo.

Set private ssh key for your Odoo server.

Start your Odoo in SSL mode.

Install Nginx in your Ubuntu Server.

Stop access of all unnecessary ports from firewall of your Ubuntu Server.

Set proper data access rights & access rules into your Odoo instance.

Set proper authentication method for your PostgreSQL database user.

Set tricky password for PostgreSQL user.

Apply encryption on Database and Odoo user passwords.

Set Tricky password for Super Admin.

Request all your ERP users to set difficult password.

Give FTP access for your ERP users and don't allow them to create files out of their directory on your Ubuntu Server.

Set proper access rights on your custom addons and default Odoo addons via chmod and chown commands.

Have a look on /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.1-main.log file for malware attack on your database.

Manage your Odoo log file properly.

Transfer database & custom addons backup to remote place at frequent amount of time.

Change and set tricky password for detault postgres user in your database server.

Stop xmlrpc if you don't want your ERP to connect from 3rd party systems. ( set xmlrpc=False in your config file )

Remove "Manage Database" link from home page of your live Odoo instance. ( it's suggestion only )

Ignore installation of Odoo where multiple other websites are hosted.

We highly recommend to ignore creation of any kind of demo database in Live Odoo instance.

Ignore to host your Odoo in Web hosting servers, always host Odoo in trusted VPS sites. ( Amazon, Raskspace, DigitalOcen, Myhosting etc..)

Monitor Incoming and outgoing TCP/IP traffics in your Ubuntu Server.  Few of our customers for whom we have implemented Odoo for more then 150+ users, they hired their own server administrator to monitor incoming and outgoing TCP/IP traffics. ( Visit this link )

Never give full access of your server to your Odoo service providers, always give them folder access of their own custom addons with their separate user. ( It's advisable to not share root user password to anyone. )

If customer can afford healthy cost, we always suggest them to set up their own in-house hosting server instead of VPS.
